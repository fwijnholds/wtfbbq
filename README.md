What the ... goes on in and around the friendly BBQ?

This project is about getting crucial data of the environment in and  around the BBQ as well as the condition of the meat.
All this data will be sent to Splunk so we can analyze all the environmental conditions that dictate the perfect piece of meat.

I got this code going on a ESP8266, although it can run on any Ardiuno with the right libraries.

Installing with Boards Manager
Starting with 1.6.4, Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using Boards Manager. They have packages available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (32 and 64 bit).
Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8 level or later. The current version is at the Arduino website.
Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLsfield. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).


Ideas and contributes are welcome.
